I was born on 4th january 2000. In addition to my professional career, I play chess at a decent level (rank 3216 in France) https://ratings.fide.com/profile/26052806, enjoy sports and dancing cuban salsa, play the piano and learn new languages (Russian and Portuguese). As a reward for my work, I will have the opportunity to be visiting a brazilian research team in November to refine LLMs to improve haematological malignancies treatment.
