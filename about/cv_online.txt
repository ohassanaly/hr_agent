SUMMARY
Data Scientist graduated from Télécom Paris. : For the past 3 years, I have been interfacing between data and
various players in the energy sector and medical field. At Enedis, I had the opportunity to advise a major
company on strategic decisions based on big data. At the Commission de Régulation de l'Energie, I
developed an operational profile capable of rapidly producing insights and synthesizing them for political
decision-makers. At AP-HP, I interact daily with clinical experts to understand their needs and propose
optimal use of data, and AI-based products. I want to be part of the current technological transformation
working with State of the Art GenAI applications. I have in-depth knowledge of AI, strong data processing
skills, proficiency in Python, and the ability to interact with both technical and non-technical audiences.
